- 👋
’ve been working in enterprise software development for years, with extensive experience in legacy systems and their evolution through the integration of modern technologies.
Over time, I’ve expanded my focus from back-end development to include front-end refactoring, UI/UX redesign, and modular middleware architecture, integrating tools like AI and SAML into environments that were never designed to support them.

- 🧩 In this space, I share technical materials I’ve developed in my spare time — often sparked by real-world needs encountered at work:

	🖌️ UI restyling with CSS inspired by Fluent UI: I completely overhauled the visuals of a legacy SPA without touching the HTML or JavaScript, relying solely on CSS.
Focus areas: color palette, reduced visual noise, consistent indicators, block-level separators, cleaner spacing, and WCAG 2.1–compliant contrast.

	🔌 Modular Middleware: A minimal, pluggable HTTP server built from scratch in TypeScript/Node.js, designed to expose technologies that can’t be integrated directly into legacy apps.

	🔐 Logical locking algorithm: A robust system for managing concurrent access to shared records, with timed locks, conditional renewal, visual countdown, and session-aware control.

	Everything I publish here is entirely self-written, with no proprietary code or references to confidential environments, names, or data.
Some screenshots show real-world examples but do not contain sensitive content.

-	🎯 Why publish? Because I believe in the quality of the work I’ve done, even when developed in technologically constrained contexts — and I see value in sharing practical solutions and engaging with the developer community.
